# About the project:
In this project we will create a rock paper scisscor game using Tkinter.We used to play this game in our childhood using symbols made by our hand.
This game has two mode:
1. Player vs Computer
2. Player vs Player

If you play with the computer then just fill your name in the appropriate place.
If you play with another player then just both of your name in the appropriate place.

Then select the mode and press **Play** button

## Player vs Computer
In this mode we just need to select(or say click) the symbol you want to choose. After that the computer will select its symbol randomly and the game result will be shown on the screen.

## Player vs Player
In this mode first player1 will select(or say click) the symbol you want to choose and then player2 will select(or say click) the symbol he want to choose. After that accordingto the game rule the result will be shown on the screen.
(Keep in mind that when player1 will be choosing the symbol, player2 must not be seeing the screen.)
